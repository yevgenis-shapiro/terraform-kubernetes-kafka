âœ… Kafka Cluster:
A Kafka cluster is a distributed system composed of multiple Kafka brokers working together to handle the storage and processing of real-time streaming data. It provides fault tolerance, scalability, and high availability for efficient data streaming and messaging in large-scale applications.
âœ… Brokers:
Brokers are the servers that form the Kafka cluster. Each broker is responsible for receiving, storing, and serving data. They handle the read and write operations from producers and consumers. Brokers also manage the replication of data to ensure fault tolerance
